# Craft CMS Dev Images

Provides a widget to generate lightweight images for missing image assets.

Have you ever imported a database dump from a remote environment into your local environment only to see missing images and broken layouts everywhere? Rather than sync down all remote images (and eat your hard drive space) you can generate temorary images for any you're missing for extensions like: `gif`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `wbmp`, `xbm`, and `svg`.

The widget only appears for Admins.

This is a work in progress, only lightly tested on a small local instance.
